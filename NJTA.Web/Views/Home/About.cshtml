        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Teaching Tamil to children was started in Edison, NJ in the year 2010 with about 65 kids and 12 volunteers like life letters of Tamil. The growing number of students each academic year helped us streamline our teaching methodologies and learning process. With the enthusiastic support of Tamil loving people (mostly parents of our school) as volunteers, we are able to run the academic efforts meeting the Tamil needs of the community.</p>

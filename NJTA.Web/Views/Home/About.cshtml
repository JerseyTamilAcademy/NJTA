            All students will get to participate in the annual cultural program that is conducted at the end of every academic year. On stage performance of the children based on their interest in drama, recital, dance, etc. exhibiting the skills is well received and liked by the Tamil community in and around Edison.<br/><br/>
            We also hold an annual oratory competition for our school children appreciating their Tamil knowledge and promoting soft skills. First 3 place winners are awarded prizes in different categories. The topics and titles grade from easy to difficult for younger to older kids. The intensity of the competition increases year after year.<br /><br />
            In addition, our Tamil school kids are invited to perform in front of huge audiences for the local competition and talent shows.<br /><br />
            We are proud to say our school children are given opportunity to gain the necessary skills not only in our language but also in the leadership and policy making areas as well. Few high school students will be selected every year to participate in the United Nation’s annual commemoration of International Day of Peace at the UN Headquarters in New York, NY that they will hear presentations from the Secretary-General and interact with UN Messengers of Peace, Goodwill Ambassadors and young leaders that aim to inspire youth to become more involved in creating a more peaceful world for all.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Teaching Tamil to children was started in Edison, NJ in the year 2010 with about 65 kids and 12 volunteers. Our school is the first ever graded Tamil school in New Jersey to follow pre-defined lesson syllabus.<br/><br/>
            The growing number of students each academic year helped us streamline our teaching methodologies and learning process. With the enthusiastic support of Tamil loving people (mostly parents of our school) as volunteers, we are able to run school with the academic efforts meeting the Tamil needs of the community.
